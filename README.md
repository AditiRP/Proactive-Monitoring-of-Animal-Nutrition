# Proactive Monitoring of Animal Nutrition
The project involves developing a smart system that leverages machine learning to continuously monitor and analyze the feeding habits of animals. This system is designed to track the daily intake patterns, types of food consumed, and feeding times, creating a detailed profile for each animal.

By applying machine learning algorithms, the system can learn the normal eating behaviors of individual animals over time. This enables it to detect any deviations from the norm, such as changes in appetite, irregular feeding times, or sudden shifts in diet preferences. These anomalies could be early indicators of health issues, stress, or other factors affecting the well-being of the animals.
